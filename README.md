# Bombon

Automagically build CycloneDX Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) for Nix packages!

Bombon generates CycloneDX v1.5 SBOMs which aim to be compliant with:

- The German [Technical Guideline TR-03183][] of the Federal Office for Information
  Security (BSI)
- The US [Executive Order 14028][]

If you find that they aren't compliant in any way, please open an issue!

## Getting Started

### Flakes

```sh
nix flake init -t github:nikstur/bombon
```

Or manually copy this to `flake.nix` in your repository:

```nix
# file: flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
    bombon.url = "github:nikstur/bombon";
    bombon.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, bombon }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
    in
    {
      packages.${system}.default = bombon.lib.${system}.buildBom pkgs.hello { };
    };
}
```

### Niv

```sh
niv init
niv add nikstur/bombon
```

```nix
# file: default.nix
let
  sources = import ./nix/sources.nix { };
  pkgs = import sources.nixpkgs { };
  bombon = import sources.bombon { inherit pkgs; };
in
bombon.buildBom pkgs.hello { }
```

## Vendored Dependencies

Some language ecosystems in Nixpkgs (most notably Rust and Go) vendor
dependencies. This means that not every dependency is its own derivation and
thus bombon cannot record their information as it does with "normal" Nix
dependencies. However, bombon can automatically read SBOMs generated by other
tools (like `cargo-cyclonedx`) for the vendored dependencies from a passthru
derivation called `bombonVendoredSbom`.

You can use the `passthruVendoredSbom.rust` function to add the
`bombonVendoredSbom` passthru derivation to a Rust package:

```nix
myPackageWithSbom = bombon.passthruVendoredSbom.rust myPackage { inherit pkgs; };
```

Or using Flakes:

```nix
myPackageWithSbom = bombon.lib.${system}.passthruVendoredSbom.rust myPackage { inherit pkgs; };
```

An SBOM built from this new derivation will now include the vendored dependencies.

## Options

`buildBom` accepts options as an attribute set. All attributes are optional:

- `extraPaths`: a list of store paths to also consider for the SBOM. This is
  useful when you build images that discard their references (e.g. with
  [`unsafeDiscardReferences`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/advanced-attributes#adv-attr-unsafeDiscardReferences)
  but you still want their contents to appear in the SBOM. The `extraPaths`
  will appear as components of the main derivation.
- `includeBuildtimeDependencies`: boolean flag to include buildtime dependencies in output.
- `excludes`: a list of regex patterns of store paths to exclude from the final
  SBOM.

Example:

```nix
bombon.lib.${system}.buildBom pkgs.hello {
  extraPaths = [ pkgs.git ];
  includeBuildtimeDependencies = true;
  excludes = [ "service" ];
}
```

`passthruVendoredSbom.rust` also accepts `includeBuildtimeDependencies` as an optional attribute.

Example:

```nix
myPackageWithSbom = bombon.passthruVendoredSbom.rust myPackage { inherit pkgs; includeBuildtimeDependencies = true; };
```

## Contributing

During development, the Nix Repl is a convenient and quick way to test changes.
Start the repl, loading your local version of nixpkgs.

```sh
nix repl <nixpkgs>
```

Inside the repl, load the bombon flake and build the BOM for a package you
are interested in.

```nix-repl
:l .
:b lib.x86_64-linux.buildBom python3 { }
```

Remember to re-load the bombon flake every time you made changes to any of the
source code.

## Acknowledgements

The way dependencies are retrieved using Nix is heavily influenced by this
